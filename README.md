<h1 align="center">Hello, World! I'm Blnd hussen</h1>

## About Me

I develop full-stack web applications covering all aspects from API design and implementation to developing the entire UI. I not only custom-build every aspect but also make sure of consistency, organisation and reliability.

## Skills

I am most familiar with tools built on top of Python and JavaScript, such as Django and Flask, for developing RESTful API’s and JS-based frameworks such as React and NextJS to build modern and performant user interfaces. I am also familiar with other tools and principles critical to development, such as:

- Version Control tools, e.g. Git and GitHub
- Design Principles and CI/CD
- Clear language and communication
